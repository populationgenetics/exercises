## Data and setup

For this exercise, we will use the same dataset that was used on Monday for [inferring population structure](https://github.com/populationgenetics/exercises/blob/master/Population_structure/ExerciseStructure_2023.md). 
The following commands will create a new folder and copy the dataset to that new folder,
but you are free to work in the `structure` folder that you created in the last exercise (in which
case, you can skip the following commands).

```bash
# make a directory called structure_fst inside ~/exercises/ and change to that directory
mkdir -p ~/exercises/structure_fst 
cd ~/exercises/structure_fst 

# Download/copy data (remember the . at the end)
cp ~/groupdirs/SCIENCE-BIO-Popgen_Course/exercises/structure/pa/* .

# List the downloaded files
ls -l
```

Today, we are going to calculate the fixation index (*F<sub>ST</sub>*), a widely used statistic in population
genetics, between subspecies of chimpanzees. This is a measure of population differentiation and thus, we
can use it to distinguish populations in a quantitative way.
It is worth noticing that what *F<sub>ST</sub>* measures is the
reduction in heterozygosity within observed populations when compared to a pooled population.

There are several methods for estimating *F<sub>ST</sub>* from genotype data. We will not
cover them in the course but if you are interested in getting an overview of some of these
estimators and how they differ, you can have a look at [this article](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/23/9/1514.full.pdf).

Here, we use the [Weir and Cockerham *F<sub>ST</sub>* estimator from 1984](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1984.tb05657.x) to
calculate *F<sub>ST</sub>*. Again, the theory behind it and the estimator itself are
not directly part of the course but if you are interested, you can find the formula that is implemented in the following R function in either
the Weir and Cockerham (1984) article and/or in equation 6 from the Bhatia et al. (2011) article linked above.

Open R and copy/paste the following function. You do not need to understand what the code does (but are welcome to try if you are interested, and ask if you have questions):

#### \>R
```R
WC84<-function(x,pop){
  # function to estimate Fst using Weir and Cockerham estimator.
  # x is NxM genotype matrix, pop is N length vector with population assignment for each sample
  # returns list with fst between population per M snps (theta) and other variables

  ###number ind in each population
  n<-table(pop)
  ###number of populations
  npop<-nrow(n)
  ###average sample size of each population
  n_avg<-mean(n)
  ###total number of samples
  N<-length(pop)
  ###frequency in samples
  p<-apply(x,2,function(x,pop){tapply(x,pop,mean)/2},pop=pop)
  ###average frequency in all samples (apply(x,2,mean)/2)
  p_avg<-as.vector(n%*%p/N )
  ###the sample variance of allele 1 over populations
  s2<-1/(npop-1)*(apply(p,1,function(x){((x-p_avg)^2)})%*%n)/n_avg
  ###average heterozygotes
  # h<-apply(x==1,2,function(x,pop)tapply(x,pop,mean),pop=pop)
  #average heterozygote frequency for allele 1
  # h_avg<-as.vector(n%*%h/N)
  ###faster version than above:
  h_avg<-apply(x==1,2,sum)/N
  ###nc (see page 1360 in wier and cockerhamm, 1984)
  n_c<-1/(npop-1)*(N-sum(n^2)/N)
  ###variance between populations
  a <-n_avg/n_c*(s2-(p_avg*(1-p_avg)-(npop-1)*s2/npop-h_avg/4)/(n_avg-1))
  ###variance between individuals within populations
  b <- n_avg/(n_avg-1)*(p_avg*(1-p_avg)-(npop-1)*s2/npop-(2*n_avg-1)*h_avg/(4*n_avg))
  ###variance within individuals
  c <- h_avg/2
  ###inbreeding (F_it)
  F <- 1-c/(a+b+c)
  ###(F_st)
  theta <- a/(a+b+c)
  ###(F_is)
  f <- 1-c(b+c)
  ###weighted average of theta
  theta_w<-sum(a)/sum(a+b+c)
  list(F=F,theta=theta,f=f,theta_w=theta_w,a=a,b=b,c=c,total=c+b+a)
}
```

## Measuring population differentiation with *F<sub>ST</sub>*

Now we will read in our data and apply the function above to each of the three pairs of subspecies to estimate their
*F<sub>ST</sub>*. We want to make three comparisons.


```R
library(snpMatrix)

# read genotype data using read.plink function form snpMatrix package
data <- read.plink("pruneddata")

# extract genotype matrix, convert to normal R integer matrix
geno <- matrix(as.integer(data@.Data),nrow=nrow(data@.Data))

# original format is 0: missing, 1: hom minor, 2: het, 3: hom major
# convert to NA: missing, 0: hom minor, 1: het, 2: hom major
geno[geno==0] <- NA
geno <- geno - 1

# keep only SNPs without missing data
g <- geno[,complete.cases(t(geno))]
```

Let's stop for a moment and look at the dimensions of the genotype matrix before and after filtering SNPs with missing data:

```R
# dimensions before filtering
dim(geno)

# dimensions after filtering
dim(g)
```

**Q1:** How many SNPs and individuals are there before and after filtering? How many SNPs did we initially have with missing data?



Let's continue in the same R session:

``` R
# load population information
popinfo <- read.table("pop.info", stringsAsFactors=F, col.names=c("pop", "ind"))

# check which subspecies we have
unique(popinfo$pop)

# save names of the three subspecies
subspecies <- unique(popinfo$pop)

# check which individuals belong to each subspecies
sapply(subspecies, function(x) popinfo$ind[popinfo$pop == x])
```

**Q2:** How many samples do we have from each subspecies? (Of course, this is easy to do by physically counting the number of elements in the vectors we just printed, but can you edit the code above to print the number of individuals for each subspecies?)


Let's continue in R and estimate the F<sub>ST</sub> values for each pair of subspecies:


``` r
# get all pairs of subspecies
subsppairs <- t(combn(subspecies, 2))

# apply fst function to each of the three subspecies pairs
fsts <- apply(subsppairs, 1, function(x) WC84(g[popinfo$pop %in% x,], popinfo$pop[popinfo$pop %in% x]))

# name each fst 
names(fsts) <- apply(subsppairs, 1, paste, collapse="_")

# print global fsts for each pair
lapply(fsts, function(x) x$theta_w)

```

Do not close R.




**Q3:** Does population differentiation correlate with the geographical
distance between subspecies? (You can find the geographical distribution of each subspecies using [Figure 1 from Monday](https://github.com/populationgenetics/exercises/blob/master/Population_structure/ExerciseStructure_2023.md#inferring-chimpanzee-population-structure-and-admixture-using-exome-data)).



**Q4:** The troglodytes and schweinfurthii populations have the same
divergence time with verus, but based on *F<sub>ST</sub>*, schweinfurthii has slightly increased differentiation from verus. Based on what we learned in today's lecture, what factors do you think could explain the difference?




## Scanning for loci under selection using an *F<sub>ST</sub>* outlier approach

In the previous section, we estimated *F<sub>ST</sub>* across all SNPs for which we have data and then estimated
a global *F<sub>ST</sub>* as the average across all SNPs. Now we will visualise local *F<sub>ST</sub>* in sliding windows across
the genome with the aim of finding regions with outlying large *F<sub>ST</sub>*.  This is a common approach that can reveal 
candidate SNPs and genes that may have been under positive selection in different populations.

First, we will define a function to generate a Manhattan plot of local *F<sub>ST</sub>* values across the genome in sliding windows.
Copy the following function; you do not need to understand it (but are welcome to try if you are interested, and ask if you have questions):


``` R
manhattanFstWindowPlot <- function(mainv, xlabv, ylabv, ylimv=NULL, window.size, step.size,chrom, fst, colpal = c("lightblue", "darkblue")){
    
    chroms <- unique(chrom)
    step.positions <- c()
    win.chroms <- c()
    
    for(c in chroms){
        whichpos <- which(chrom==c)
        chrom.steps <- seq(whichpos[1] + window.size/2, whichpos[length(whichpos)] - window.size/2, by=step.size)
        step.positions <- c(step.positions, chrom.steps)
        win.chroms <- c(win.chroms, rep(c, length(chrom.steps)))
    }
    
    n <- length(step.positions)
    fsts <- numeric(n)
    # estimate per window weighted fst
    for (i in 1:n) {
        chunk_a <- fst$a[(step.positions[i]-window.size/2):(step.positions[i]+window.size/2)]
        chunk_b <- fst$b[(step.positions[i]-window.size/2):(step.positions[i]+window.size/2)]
        chunk_c <- fst$c[(step.positions[i]-window.size/2):(step.positions[i]+window.size/2)]
        fsts[i] <-  sum(chunk_a) / sum(chunk_a + chunk_b + chunk_c)
    }

    
    plot(x=1:length(fsts),y=fsts,main=mainv,xlab=xlabv,ylab=ylabv,cex=1,
         pch=20, cex.main=1.25, col=colpal[win.chroms %% 2 + 1], xaxt="n")

    yrange <- range(fsts)

    text(y=yrange[1] - c(0.05, 0.07) * diff(yrange) * 2, x=tapply(1:length(win.chroms), win.chroms, mean), labels=unique(win.chroms), xpd=NA)

	zz <- fsts[!is.na(fsts)]
	abline(h=quantile(zz,0.999,na.rem=TRUE),col="red", lty=2, lwd=2)
	abline(h=mean(fsts), lty=2, lwd=2)
}
```

Do not close R.

Using this function, we will now produce a Manhattan plot for each of the three subspecies pairs:


``` R
# read bim file to get info on snp location
bim <- read.table("pruneddata.bim", h=F, stringsAsFactors=F)

# keep only sites without missing data (to get same sites we used for fst)
bim <- bim[complete.cases(t(geno)),]

# keep chromosome and bp coordinate of each snp and define pairnames
snpinfo <- data.frame(chr=bim$V1, pos=bim$V4)
pairnames <- apply(subsppairs, 1, paste, collapse=" ")

# group snps in windows of 10, with sliding window of 1
windowsize <- 10
steps <- 1

# make the plots
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
for(pair in 1:3){
    mainvv = paste("Sliding window Fst:", pairnames[pair], "SNPs =", length(fsts[[pair]]$theta), "Win: ", windowsize, "Step: ", steps)
    manhattanFstWindowPlot(mainvv, "Chromosome", "Fst", window.size=windowsize, step.size=steps, fst =fsts[[pair]], chrom=snpinfo$chr)
}

```

If you want to save the plot on the server as a png (so you can then download it to your own computer, or visualise it on the server), you can use the following code:

``` R
bitmap("manhattan.png", w=8, h=8, res=300)
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
for(pair in 1:3){
    mainvv = paste("Sliding window Fst:", pairnames[pair], "SNPs =", length(fsts[[pair]]$theta), "Win: ", windowsize, "Step: ", steps)
    manhattanFstWindowPlot(mainvv, "Chromosome", "Fst", window.size=windowsize, step.size=steps, fst =fsts[[pair]], chrom=snpinfo$chr)
}
dev.off()
```

Do not close R.



In the plot we have just generated, the black dotted line indicates the mean F<sub>ST</sub> value across all windows and the red dotted line the 99.9% percentile (i.e. where only 0.1% of the windows have an F<sub>ST</sub> above that value). One way to define outlying windows is to only consider windows that have an F<sub>ST</sub> above the 99.9% percentile (this value is necessarily arbitrary).


**Q5:** Compare the peaks of high *F<sub>ST</sub>* in the three subspecies pairs. Do they tend to be found in the same position? Would you expect this to be the case? Why/why not?




**Q6:** Most of the top *F<sub>ST</sub>* windows are found in groups of nearby windows with high *F<sub>ST</sub>*. Can you explain or guess why that happens?





### EXTRA - Exploring genes in candidate regions for selection

We have now identified several SNPs that are candidates for having been positively selected in some
populations. Now we can try to see what genes these SNPs are located in (the genotype data we have been working with
comes from exome sequencing, meaning that SNPs will always be located within genes).

To do so, we need to know the genomic coordinates of the outlier windows in the Manhattan plot.

Copy and paste the following function into R; this will return the top n (default n=20) windows with maximum *F<sub>ST</sub>* for a given
pairwise comparison. Again, you do not need to understand what the code does (but are welcome to try if you are interested, and ask if you have questions):

```r
topWindowFst <- function(window.size, step.size, chrom, pos, fst, n_tops = 20){
    
    chroms <- unique(chrom)
    step.positions <- c()
    win.chroms <- c()
    
    for(c in chroms){
        whichpos <- which(chrom==c)
        chrom.steps <- seq(whichpos[1] + window.size/2, whichpos[length(whichpos)] - window.size/2, by=step.size)
        step.positions <- c(step.positions, chrom.steps)
        win.chroms <- c(win.chroms, rep(c, length(chrom.steps)))
    }
    
    n <- length(step.positions)
    fsts <- numeric(n)
    win.coord <- character(n)

    # estimate per window weighted fst
    for (i in 1:n) {
        chunk_a <- fst$a[(step.positions[i]-window.size/2):(step.positions[i]+window.size/2)]
        chunk_b <- fst$b[(step.positions[i]-window.size/2):(step.positions[i]+window.size/2)]
        chunk_c <- fst$c[(step.positions[i]-window.size/2):(step.positions[i]+window.size/2)]
        fsts[i] <-  sum(chunk_a) / sum(chunk_a + chunk_b + chunk_c)
       
        c <- win.chroms[i]
        win.coord[i] <- paste0(c, ":", pos[step.positions[i]-window.size/2], "-", pos[step.positions[i]+window.size/2])
    }

    ord <- order(fsts, decreasing=T)

    return(data.frame(position=win.coord[ord][1:n_tops], fst=fsts[ord][1:n_tops]))
}
```


Now we can use the function to identify where the top hits from the previous plot are located.
Let's have a look the top 10 *F<sub>ST</sub>* windows between troglodytes and schweinfurthii:

``` r
windowsize <- 10
steps <- 1
topWindowFst(window.size=windowsize, step.size=steps, chrom=snpinfo$chr, pos=snpinfo$pos, fst=fsts[[1]], n=10)

```



**Q7:** What are the genomic coordinates of the window with the highest *F<sub>ST</sub>*?




Now let's look at some gene annotations at this location. Open the [chimpanzee genome assembly in the UCSC genome browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=panTro5&lastVirtModeType=default&lastVirtModeExtraState=&virtModeType=default&virtMode=0&nonVirtPosition=&position=chr1%3A78555444%2D78565444&hgsid=1293765481_hOBCvmiwGLVKt1SRo9yIaRFa0wYc) and copy/paste the chromosome and coordinates of the top window in the search bar (paste the coordinates in the same format as what was printed in R (i.e. chr:start-end)).

**Q8:** Is this window within a gene? If so, can you figure out the name of the gene and its possible function? (Hint: click on the drawing of the gene on the 'Non-Chimp RefSeq Genes' track. This track describes genes identified in other organisms that have high sequence similarity to the observed region of the chimp genome. This suggests that the gene may also be present in that region of the chimp genome).




**Q9:** Can we conclude that selection on this gene has driven biological differentiation between the troglodytes and schweinfurthii chimpanzee subspecies?
