## Inferring chimpanzee population structure and admixture using exome data

Disentangling the chimpanzee taxonomy has been surrounded with much
attention, and with continuously newly discovered populations of
chimpanzees, controversies still exist about the true number of
subspecies. The unresolved taxonomic labelling of chimpanzee populations
has negative implications for future conservation planning for this
endangered species. In this exercise, we will use around 50.000 SNPs from the
chimpanzee exome to infer population structure and admixture of
chimpanzees in Africa, in order to acquire thorough knowledge of the
population structure and thus help guide future conservation management
programs. We make use of 29 wild born chimpanzees from across their
natural distributional area (Figure 1).

## PCA

We start by creating a directory for this exercise and downloading the exome data to the folder.

Open a terminal and copy in the following code (and note that everything in the code on a line after # is a comment and gives you a description of what the next line(s) of code does. So if you read these this should help you follow what is going on in the code):

```bash
# Make a directory for this exercise in an appropriate folder
mkdir structure
cd structure

# Download data (remember the . in the end)
cp ~/groupdirs/SCIENCE-BIO-Popgen_Course/exercises/structure/pa/* .

# Show a list of files i thus directory and thus of the files you downloaded
ls -l
```
You have now downloaded a PLINK file-set consisting of

- pruneddata.**fam**: Information about each individual (one line per individual)
- pruneddata.**bim**: Information about each SNP/variant (one line per SNP/variant)
- pruneddata.**bed**: A non-human-readable *binary* file-format of the all variants for all individuals.

and a separate file containing assumed population info for each sample.

- pop.info

First, we want to look at the data (like you always should *before* doing any analyses). The command `wc -l FILENAME` counts the number of lines in a given file (if you replace "FILENAME" by the name of that file). Use this and the information about the content of the files to answer the following question:

<br />

**Q1: How many samples and variants do the downloaded PLINK file-set consist of?**

<br />

Now open R in your structure exercise directory (don’t close it before this manual states that you should) and type:
```R
popinfo <- read.table("pop.info")
table(popinfo[,1])
```

<br />

**Q2**
  - **Q2.1: Which subspecies are represented in the data?**
  - **Q2.2: How many samples are there from each subspecies?**
  - **Q2.3: Does the total number of samples match what you found in Q1?**

<br />

Now we want to import our genotype data into R. 

```R
# Load the data into a variable called geno
library(snpMatrix)
data <- read.plink("pruneddata")
geno <- matrix(as.integer(data@.Data),nrow=nrow(data@.Data))
geno[geno==0] <- NA
geno <- geno-1

# Show the number of rows and columns
dim(geno)

# Show counts of genotypes for SNP/variant 17
table(geno[,17], useNA='a')

# Show counts of genotypes for sample 1 
table(geno[1,], useNA='a')
```

<br />

**Q3**
  - **Q3.1: How many SNPs and samples have you loaded into *geno*? and does it match what you found in Q1 and Q2?**
  - **Q3.2: How many samples are heterozygous for SNP 17 (*what does the 0, 1, and 2 mean*)?**
  - **Q3.3: How many SNPs is missing data (*NA*) for sample 8 (*you need to change the code to find the information for sample 8*)**

<br />

Specialized software (ex. [PCAngsd](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.301336)) can handle missing information in a clever way, but for now we will simply remove all sites that have missing information and then perform PCA with the standard R-function `prcomp`. 

```R
# Number of missing samples per site
nMis <- colSums(is.na(geno))

# Only keep sites with 0 missing samples.
geno <- geno[,nMis==0]

# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(geno, scale=T, center=T)

# Show summary
summary(pca)

# Extract importance of PCs.
pca_importance <- summary(pca)$importance
plot(pca_importance[2,], type='b', xlab='PC', ylab='Proportion of variance', las=1,
	pch=19, col='darkred', bty='L', main='Proportion of variance explained per PC')
```

<br />

**Q4: Which principal components (PCs) are most important in terms of variance explained and how much variance do they explain together (cumulative)?**

<br />


Now let's plot the first two principal components.

```R
# Extract percentage of the variance that is explained by PC1 and PC2
PC1_explained <- round(pca_importance[2,1]*100, 1)
PC2_explained <- round(pca_importance[2,2]*100, 1)

# Extract the PCs
pcs <- as.data.frame(pca$x)

# Custom colors matching the original colors on the map.
palette(c('#E69F00', '#D55E00', '#56B4E9'))
plot(pcs$PC1, pcs$PC2, col=popinfo$V1, pch=19, las=1, bty='L',
	main='PCA on 29 wild-born chimpanzees',
	xlab=paste0('PC1 (', PC1_explained, '% of variance)'),
	ylab=paste0('PC2 (', PC2_explained, '% of variance)'))
legend('topleft', legend=levels(popinfo$V1), col=1:length(levels(popinfo$V1)), pch=19)
```
<br />

**Q5**

- **Q5.1 How many separate PCA-clusters are found in the first two PCs?**
- **Q5.2 Which populations are separated by PC1? How does this match the geography from Figure 1 (top of document)**
- **Q5.3 Do the PCs calculated only from genetic data match the information from the pop.info file (i.e. do any of the samples cluster with a different population than specified by the sample-info/color)?**

<br />

Save/screenshot the plot for later. Now close R by typing `q()` and hit `Enter` (no need to save the workspace).

**BONUS(If you finish early)**: Very often we cannot load all the data into R, so we need to calculate PCA using software such as PLINK. Using google and/or `plink --help`, try to perform PCA on the data with PLINK (remember to remove missingness) and plot the results using R

## Admixture

Now we know that the populations look like they are separated into three
distinct clusters (in accordance to the three subspecies), but we also
want to know whether there has been any admixture between the three
subspecies given that at least two of the subspecies have neighboring
ranges (Figure 1). The ADMIXTURE manual can be found
[here](http://dalexander.github.io/admixture/admixture-manual.pdf).

When running ADMIXTURE, we input a certain number of ancestral populations, *K*.
Then ADMIXTURE picks a random starting point (the *seed*) and tries to find the 
parameters (admixture proportions and ancestral frequencies) resulting in the highest likelihood. 

First, lets try to run ADMIXTURE once assuming *K=3* ancestral populations.
```bash
# Make sure you are in the ~/exercises/structure/ directory
cd ~/exercises/structure/

# Run admixture once
admixture -s 1 pruneddata.bed 3 > pruneddata_K3_run1.log

# Look at output files
ls -l
```

<br />

**Q6**
- **Q6.1 What is in the output files pruneddata.3.Q, pruneddata.3.P, and pruneddata_K3_run1.log files? (*Hints: Use `less -S` to look in the files. Use `wc -l [FILE]` to count the number of lines in the files. Look in the manual*)**
- **Q6.2 What is the ancestral proportions (of the three populations) of sample 4?**
- **Q6.3 Is it admixed and can we say which subspecies its from?**
- **Q6.4 What is the final Loglikelihood of the fit?**
- **Q6.5 Can we be sure that this is the best overall fit for this data - why/why not? (*hint: see next part of exercise, but remember to explain why*)**

<br />


Now, let's run the model fit 10 times with different seeds (different starting points)
```bash
# Assumed number of ancestral populations 
K=3

# Do something 10 times
for i in {1..10}
do
   # Run admixture with seed i
   admixture -s ${i} pruneddata.bed ${K} > pruneddata_K${K}_run${i}.log
   
   # Rename the output files
   cp pruneddata.${K}.Q pruneddata_K${K}_run${i}.Q
   cp pruneddata.${K}.P pruneddata_K${K}_run${i}.P
done

# Show the likelihood of all the 10 runs (in a sorted manner):
grep ^Loglikelihood: *K${K}*log | sort -k2
```

<br />

**Q7**
- **Q7.1 Which run-numbers have the 3 highest Loglikelihoods?**
- **Q7.2 Has the model(s) converged? (*rule of thumb: it's converged if we have 3 runs within ± 1 loglikelihood unit*)**
- **Q7.3 Which run would you use as the result to plot?**

<br />

Now let's plot the run ancestral proportions from the best fit for each sample. **Open R**.

```R
# Margins and colors
par(mar=c(7,3,2,1), mgp=c(2,0.6,0))
palette(c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#D55E00", "#999999"))

# Load sample names
popinfo <- read.table("pop.info")
sample_names <- popinfo$V2

# Read sample ancestral proportions
snp_k3_run5 <- as.matrix(read.table("pruneddata_K3_run5.Q"))

barplot(t(snp_k3_run5), col=c(3,2,1), names.arg=sample_names, cex.names=0.8,
	border=NA, main="K=3 - Run 5", las=2, ylab="Ancestry proportion")
```

Save/screenshot the plot for later. Close R by typing `q()` and hit `Enter` (no need to save the workspace).

<br />

**Q8**
- **Q8.1 Explain the plot - what is shown for each sample?**
- **Q8.2 Does the assigned ancestral proportions match the subpecies classification for each sample?**
- **Q8.3 Can you find any admixed samples? How does/would an admixed sample look? What about e.g. an F1, e.i. an indivual with unadmixed parents with different ancestries? And a backcross, i.e. the offspring of an F1 and an unadmixed sample with the same ancestry as one of the F1's parents?**
- **Q8.4 Could the model have assumed only 2 ancestral populations (*K*) in these runs?**

<br />

Now, run admixture 10 times assuming only two ancestral populations (**K=2**). You can use the code from K=3, but changing K.


<br />

**Q9**
- **Q9.1 Did the model(s) converge?**
- **Q9.2 Which model had the highest and which has the lowest loglikelihood?**

<br />

Open R again and let's plot the best and the worst fit.

First we plot the best:

```R
# Margins and colors
par(mar=c(7,3,2,1), mgp=c(2,0.6,0))
palette(c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#D55E00", "#999999"))

# Load sample names
popinfo <- read.table("pop.info")
sample_names <- popinfo$V2

# Read sample ancestral proportions
snp_k2_run1 <- as.matrix(read.table("pruneddata_K2_run1.Q"))

barplot(t(snp_k2_run1), col=c(2,1), names.arg=sample_names, cex.names=0.8,
   border=NA, main="K=2 - Run 1 (best fit)", las=2, ylab="Ancestry proportion")
```

Save/screenshot the plot for later.

Then we plot the worst:

```R
# Read sample ancestral proportions
snp_k2_run4 <- as.matrix(read.table("pruneddata_K2_run4.Q"))

barplot(t(snp_k2_run4), col=c(2,1), names.arg=sample_names, cex.names=0.8,
   border=NA, main="K=2 - Run 4 (worst fit)", las=2, ylab="Ancestry proportion")
```

Save/screenshot the plot for later. Close R by typing `q()` and hit `Enter` (no need to save the workspace).

<br />

**Q10**
- **Q10.1 Would the conclusion be different if you used the worst compared to the best?**

<br />

Run admixture 10 times assuming 4 ancestral populations (K=4).

<br />

**Q11**
- **Q11.1 Did the model(s) converge?**
- **Q11.2 Which model had the highest and which has the lowest loglikelihood?**

<br />

It turns out that the model(s) eventually converges with the best fit at seed i=52. Run that single seed:

```bash
# Assumed number of ancestral populations 
K=4

# Specific seed
i=52

# Run admixture and rename output files
admixture -s ${i} pruneddata.bed ${K} > pruneddata_K${K}_run${i}.log
cp pruneddata.${K}.Q pruneddata_K${K}_run${i}.Q
cp pruneddata.${K}.P pruneddata_K${K}_run${i}.P

grep ^Loglikelihood: *K${K}*log | sort -k2
```

Now plot this converged best fit:
```R
# Margins and colors
par(mar=c(7,3,2,1), mgp=c(2,0.6,0))
palette(c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#D55E00", "#999999"))

# Load sample names
popinfo <- read.table("pop.info")
sample_names <- popinfo$V2

# Read sample ancestral proportions
snp_k4_run52 <- as.matrix(read.table("pruneddata_K4_run52.Q"))

barplot(t(snp_k4_run52), col=c(3,4,1,2), names.arg=sample_names, cex.names=0.8,
   border=NA, main="K=4 - Run 52 (Best fit)", las=2, ylab="Ancestry proportion")
```

Save/screenshot the plot for later. Plot the worst fit:

```R
# Read sample ancestral proportions
snp_k4_run4 <- as.matrix(read.table("pruneddata_K4_run4.Q"))

barplot(t(snp_k4_run4), col=c(3,2,1,4), names.arg=sample_names, cex.names=0.8,
   border=NA, main="K=4 - Run 4 (Worst fit, not converged)", las=2, ylab="Ancestry proportion")
```

Save/screenshot the plot for later. Close R by typing `q()` and hit `Enter` (no need to save the workspace).

**Q12 Looking at all the results (PCA and admixture K=2, K=3, and K=4)**
- **Q12.1 Do the admixture and PCA analysis correspond with the known geography?**
- **Q12.2 Which number of ancestral populations do you find the most likely?**
- **Q12.3 What are the possible explanations for the K=4 admixture results?**
- **Q12.4 Does it look like we have admixed samples?**
- **Q12.5 Can we conclude anything about admixture between the subspecies?**

**Q13 Extra exercise: assessing the obtained models for K=2-4**:

Let's now finally try to assess the fit of the models that we obtaining usign ADMIXTURE. To do so we first copy the program evalAdmix and a plotting script that help you plots the evalAdmix output to you structure exercise folder:
```bash
cp ~/groupdirs/SCIENCE-BIO-Popgen_Course/exercises/structure/evalAdmix .
cp ~/groupdirs/SCIENCE-BIO-Popgen_Course/exercises/structure/visFuns.R .
```
Second we want to run evalAdmix on the best solution from ADMXITURE for each of K=2-4. evalAdmix needs a few things specificed: the prefix of the files that contain the data (option -plink), the name of the P file from ADMIXTURE (option -fname), the name of the Q file from ADMIXTURE (option -qname) and the name you want the output file to have (option -o). So to assess the fit for K=2 (where the best run was run 1) we would run the command in the terminal:

```bash
./evalAdmix -plink pruneddata -fname pruneddata_K2_run1.P -qname pruneddata_K2_run1.Q -o K2.output.corres.txt
```

Try to run that command and the corresponding commands for K=3 and 4.

Next we want to plot the results. To do so open R and run the following R code, which plots the evalAdmix results for K=2:
 
```R
# Read in plotting functions
source("visFuns.R")

# Read in the population info
popinfo <- read.table("pop.info")
pop = as.vector(popinfo[,1])

# Read in the output 
r <- as.matrix(read.table("K2.output.corres.txt"))
plotCorRes(cor_mat = r, pop = pop, title = "Correlation of residuals (K=2)", max_z=0.15, min_z=-0.15)
```

Try to also plot the evalAdmix results for K=3 and 4.
Now finally have a look at the results. 

- **Q13.1 Does it look like K=2 provides a good fit (judging from the lower right triangle)?**
- **Q13.2 Does it look like K=3 provides a good fit (judging from the lower right triangle)?**
- **Q13.3 Does it look like K=4 provides a good fit (judging from the lower right triangle)?**
- **Q13.4 Does looking at the upper left triangle in the K=3 plot tell us something about why the trogl samples split into 2 ancestry groups in the K=4 ADMIXTURE plot? (in a plot of a good fitting model a high correlation value for a pair of individuals in the upper left triangle indicates that the two individuals are related)**
