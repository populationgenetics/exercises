# Linkage disequilibrium

 

**Hans R Siegismund**



**Exercise 1**

Take a look at the variation at two SNPs in the human genome:


|     |   |**SNP83**|    |
|-----|---|----:|---:|
|     |   |_B_  | _b_|
|**SNP82**|_A_| 22  |9   |
|     |_a_| 0   |20  |

Use the “LD test” sheet in “Hardy Weinberg test, LD test.xls” file to
estimate

1)  Haplotype frequencies

2)  Allele frequencies

3)  The linkage disequilibrium parameter *D*

4)  *χ2* test for independent distribution at the two loci

5)  *D<sub>max </sub>*

6)  *D<sub>min</sub>*

7)  *D´* = *D/D<sub>max</sub>* if *D* is positive
    *D´* = *D/D<sub>min</sub>* if *D* is negative

8)  *r*<sup>2</sup>

**Exercise 2**

**Population admixture**

Use the sheet “LD in admixed populations” in the “Hardy Weinberg test,
LD test.xls” file to estimate the effects of admixture of two
populations that have the following haplotype frequencies:

|                |AB  | Ab |aB  |ab  |
|----------------|---:|:---:|:---:|---:|
|**Population 1**|1   |  9 |  9 |  81|
|**Population 2**| 81 |  9 |  9 |   1|

1)  Is there any sign of LD in the two populations?

2)  Assume that the admixed population consists of 50% from each of the
    source populations. What is the LD in the admixed population? (Let
    the sample size be 100.)

3)  Assume that the two loci are unlinked. What will *D* be in the next
    generation (i.e. offspring of the admixed population.)?
